		What is special about Sri Lanka?
	</h2></li>
	<p class="a">

Sri Lanka is what Sir Horace Walpole referred to as Serendipity, the place of ‘happy accidents’. 
It is the very unexpectedness of Sri Lanka which makes it a unique travel destination.<br> The culture 
and traditions of the island are fascinating whether it be the rituals of a religious ceremony
 such as the chanting of pirith or the exuberance traditional dancing style referred <br> to as Kandyan 
 Dancing. Customs and values are deeply ingrained in the psyche of the people as are <br>their folk tales
  and myths which recollect the origins of the Sinhalese race in the lion king Sinhabahu, the
   establishment <br>of pre-historic settlement in Lanka as discovered through the story of Rama 
   and Sita in the Ramayana or the thrilling tale of parricide and sibling rivalry at Sigiriya.<br>
	Ayurvedic medicine which is probably older than some of these folk tales is still practiced 
	in the island today and its transcendental and therapeutic <br>powers have contributed to healing 
	both the mind and body. Beautiful beaches can be found on the west, south, east and north coast’s 
	while the island <br>also boasts of 8 designated UNESCO World Heritage
	 Sites such as Galle, Dambulla and the Sinharaja Rain Forest to name a few.<br>
